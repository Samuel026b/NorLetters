# NorLetters
### This is what the program can do with Norwegian Wikipedia pages:
1. Count letters of a given page;
2. Find pages with unusual letter statistics (if wanted, ignoring short pages or pages that have those letters found unusual in the page's title);
3. Count average statistics of letter usage from random pages.
